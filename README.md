Construct
=========

Construct aims to be the best 'out of the box' starting point
for building an editable website for a small to medium company.

The 3 laws of Construct:

1. Construct sites are as easy as possible to edit and update by a site admin.

   Editing should be in-place wherever possible.
   Editing access control should be flexible without giving 'enough rope to hang themselves'.

2. Construct sites must adhere to modern standards out of the box.

   This currently means:
   clean semantic html5 / css,
   a responsive cross-browser theme,
   search engine / social network optimisation.

3. Construct sites must allow a developer to quickly and efficiently create a website.

   This means that a design/theme must be easily implemented.
   Common functionality is provided by included modules.
   Development tools are included to allow for easy testing and optimising.
